                    <br>
                    The skater accelerates himself upward by explosively straightening his legs and raising his arms. During the jump, his rear foot exerts a much greater force on the tail of the board than his front foot does on the nose, causing the board to pivot counterclockwise about the rear wheel.
                    <br>
                    As the tail strikes the ground, the ground exerts a large upward force on the tail. The result of this upward force is that the board bounces up and begins to pivot clockwise, this time around its center of mass.
                    <br>
                    With the board now completely in the air, the skater slides his front foot forward, using the friction between his foot and the rough surface of the board to drag the board upward even higher.
                    <br>
                    The skater begins to push his front foot down, raising the rear wheels and leveling out the board. Meanwhile, he lifts his rear leg to get it out of the way of the rising tail of the board. If he times this motion perfectly, his rear foot and the rear of the board rise in perfect unison, seemingly "stuck" together.
                    <br>
                    The board is now level at its maximum height. With both feet touching the board, the skater and board begin to fall together under the influence of gravity.

                    <span class="trick-name"> - 180 kickflip</span>
                    <br>
                    
                1. The foot position is a mixture between the a FS 180 Ollie and a Kickflip.
                Your back foot should be placed on the outside part of the tail while your front foot is placed slightly behind the bolts of your front truck and slanted like the Kickflip position.
                    <br>
                2. Like with the Frontside 180 Ollie, it’s important to use your shoulders.
                    <br>
                Before you pop your board, build up momentum with your shoulders by bending down just like with the Frontside 180 Ollie and prepare yourself for the Frontside 180 motion.
                    <br>
                3. It’s important to pop the tail down and forward with your back foot a to help with the the 180 turn of the trick.
                The rotation or flip of the board is made with the Kickflip motion of your front foot.
                Bend down to build momentum and then pop and jump like in the FS 180 Ollie motion and kick your front foot out just like in the Kickflip motion simultaneously as you do the Frontside 180 motion.
                    <br>
                4. This takes a while to get the timing of the FS 180 and the Kickflip motion well coordinated.
                    <br>
                At first you will probably land it 90 degrees, but that’s ok just keep practicing until you get the whole 180 degree turn.
                    <br>
                5. Just like the Frontside 180 Ollie, in the beginning you can land with your weight on your front truck and slide the back truck and the rest of your body with it.
