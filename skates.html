                    A longboard is a type of sports equipment similar to, but not the same as, a skateboard. It is often longer than a skateboard and has a wide variety of shapes. It tends to be faster because of wheel size, construction materials and more precise hardware. Longboards are commonly used for cruising, travelling and downhill racing, known as longboarding, rather than skateboarding. Longboard 'dancing' and 'freestyle' are also becoming more popular styles, in which the rider utilises skateboard-like motions and steps up and down the board, generally in a fluid manner.

                    A Penny board is a type of plastic skateboard, known within the industry as a short cruiser. The term "Penny" is synonymous with "Penny Skateboards", an Australian-based company founded in 2010 by Ben Mackay.[1] Penny is a registered trademark for skateboards, but has been widely genericised to describe all small plastic skateboards due to the brand's popularity. Penny Skateboards pair a plastic deck with cruiser wheels and trucks. This combination now epitomises a "Penny board" in generic terms.
                    <br>
                    Penny boards are sold in four different deck sizes, the 22 in (55.9 cm), 27 in (68.6 cm) (the Nickel), 32 in (81.3 cm) cruiser and 36 in (91.4 cm) longboard.

                    Carveboarding is a boardsport on hard surfaces (roads, sidewalks, etc.).
                    <br>
                    Carveboard is also the brand name of the board which popularized the practice of this sport.
                    <br>
                    The board was invented by Californian snowboarder & surfers (David Colley and Brad Gerlach) to practice their moves during flat sea days and summer. The result is a board that shares with the surfing, snowboarding, skateboard ride experience. And although by its anatomy (a board, 2 trucks, 4-wheel) the carveboard looks somewhat like its cousins skateboards, the handling and feel are ultimately much closer to those of surfing and snowboarding. Joe Gerlach, Brad's father, started Carve Board Sports based on the design.
                    <br>
                    The practice reminds of, better known, longboarding. However, it emphasizes the work of the turn for which it provides all the variations of the carve. Some models are equipped with pneumatic (air filled) tires, so use on rougher surfaces (asphalt, pavement, hard.
